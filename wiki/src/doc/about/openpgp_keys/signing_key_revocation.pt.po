"  C. Allow a coalition of people, not necessarily from tails@boum.org, to\n"
"     revoke our signing key in case everybody or almost everybody from\n"
"     tails@boum.org becomes unavailable.\n"
"  D. Make it hard for a coalition of people not from tails@boum.org to revoke\n"
"     our signing key unless everybody or almost everybody from tails@boum.org\n"
"     becomes unavailable.\n"
"  E. People not from tails@boum.org shouldn't know how the shares are spread\n"

"  F. People in possession of a share of the revocation certificate\n"
"     of the signing key should have instructions on how to use it if needed.\n"

"The idea is to distribute cryptographic shares of this revocation "
