  Refer to this article from NN/g on [presenting bulleted
  lists](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/presenting-bulleted-lists/).

- *Debian and Ubuntu version*

  Refer to Debian versions primarily by their number, and additionally
  by their codename.

  * *For example*:
    - Tails 3.0 is based on Debian 9 (Stretch)
    - *Tails Installer* is available on Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf) or later.

- **graphics card**

  And not *graphics adapters*, *graphics*, or *graphical hardware*.

- **persistence feature**

  To refer to the features available in the configuration of the
  *persistent volume*.

  - *For example*: when the <span class="guilabel">Additional
    Software</span> persistence feature is activated.

  The word *persistence* can be omitted if it is redundant from the context
  (for example on [[doc/first_steps/persistence/configure]]).

- **startup options**

  To refer to the kernel command line options that can be specified from
  the *Boot Loader Menu*.

  * *For example:* Adding `radeon.dpm=0` to the [[startup
    options|/doc/first_steps/startup_options#boot_menu]].

- **<span class="application">Tails Greeter</span>**

  Without an article. Not *the Greeter*. Note the formatting as an application.
