## Possible candidates:

### Briar

- decentralized
- works over Tor
- no Linux client yet

### Matrix/Riot

- [https://matrix.org/docs/projects/client/riot.html](Riot website)
- [[!tails_ticket 15209]]
- decentralized
- Riot supports: IM, VoIP, Videocall & - conferencing, File Transfer (of course) and SMS
- bridges to Slack, Gitter, IRC, Telegram, Twitter etc.
- works over Tor
- TLS by default
- Debian packages, but no official ones

### Ring.cx

- end-to-end encrypted
- video calls

### Signal

- [https://signal.org](Signal website)
- [[!tails_ticket 15200]]
- centralized server
- mass adopted
- Chromium-based desktop application is deprecated, it's going to be
  replaced by a [https://electron.atom.io/](Electron framework based)
  standalone application, i.e. it's supposed to work in all major OS'es
  but we don't know if such applications will actually be officially
  available in Debian
- double ratchet
- instant messaging
- Tor?
- have to enter a phone number

### Telegram

- works over Tor (You can configure Tor as a SOCKS5 proxy in the configuration. The traffic seems to go through HTTP.)
- [https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/telegram-desktop](is in Debian)
- When first starting the app, you have to enter your phone number and validate it through an SMS. Then you get all your messages and conversations back, even your stickers!
- So it's not anonymous in the sense that it's linked with your phone number but it's super easy :)
- instant messaging

### Wire

- [https://wire.com](Wire website)
- desktop client
- works over Tor
- video & audio calls
- instant messaging works in Tails
- audio calls work in Tails but firewall rules are impacted [[!tails_ticket 15196]]
- video call untested
- problematic: [https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/gvzw5x/secure-messaging-app-wire-stores-everyone-youve-ever-contacted-in-plain-text](Stores contacts in cleartext on server)
