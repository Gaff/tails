Recording with a camera using <span class="application">VLC</span>
==================================================================

Recording the screen with an external camera has the following
advantages over recording with a screencast:

- Recording a whole session, even if the user restarts Tails.
- Saving the video directly to your computer and not relying on the
  computer used for the tests.

You can use a document camera. The [Ziggi-HD Plus by
IPEVO](https://www.ipevo.com/) works fine from Tails.

1. Move the <span class="guilabel">AF</span> switch of the camera to <span class="guilabel">C</span> to have continuous autofocus.

1. Install <span class="application">VLC</span>:

   <p class="pre command">apt install vlc</p>

### Prepare the camera for recording

1. In <span class="application">VLC</span>, choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Media</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Open Capture Device...</span></span>.

1. In the <span class="guilabel">Capture Device</span> tab, select:

   - <span class="guilabel">Video device name</span>: /dev/video1
   - <span class="guilabel">Audio device name</span>: hw:1,0

1. Click the <span class="button">Play</span> button.

1. Make sure that the microphone of the camera is captured as well.

1. Adjust the orientation of the camera to capture as much of the screen as
   possible while not obfuscating the light of sight of the participant.

### Start recording

1. In <span class="application">VLC</span>, choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Media</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Convert / Save...</span></span>.

1. In the <span class="guilabel">Capture Device</span> tab, select:

   - <span class="guilabel">Video device name</span>: /dev/video1
   - <span class="guilabel">Audio device name</span>: hw:1,0

1. Click the <span class="button">Convert / Save</span> button.

1. In the <span class="guilabel">Convert</span> dialog:

   - Select the
     <span class="guilabel">Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4)</span> profile.

   - Specify a destination file under
     <span class="filename">~/Persistent/</span>.

Recording a screencast
======================

Recording the screen with a screencast has the following advantages over
recording with an external camera:

- Better image quality
- Lighter setup

Using <span class="application">recordMyDesktop</span>
------------------------------------------------------

You can use
[<span class="application">recordMyDesktop</span>](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/)
from Tails:

1. Install <span class="application">recordMyDesktop</span>:

   <p class="pre command">apt install recordmydesktop</span>

1. Navigate to a folder under <span class="filename">~/Persistent/.

   <p class="pre command">recordmydesktop --on-the-fly-encoding --buffer-size 8192 --fps 10 --channels 1 <span class="command-placeholder">output.ogv</span></p>

Using GNOME Shell
-----------------

Press <span class="keycap">Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R</span> in GNOME to start or stop
capturing a screencast.

The video is saved to <span class="filename">~/Videos/</span>.
