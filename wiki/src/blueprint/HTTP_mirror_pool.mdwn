# The plan

## Big picture

We decided to implement a two-way strategy for this feature:

* We have dispatcher code, in JavaScript, that DAVE uses to dynamically modify the
  hostname, in the download link it gets from the ISO description file
  (IDF), so that each user is pointed to random mirror.
  - [public read-only mirror of the Git repository](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/mirror-pool-dispatcher/)
  - Vanilla JS (no frameworks)
  - The code is deployed live: <https://tails.boum.org/lib/js/mirror-dispatcher.js>
  - The code must work from inside a Firefox extension (DAVE) at
    least; ideally it is library code that can also be used from a web
    page (see below for an actual use case).
  - Configuration for the JS is loaded from a JSON file hosted on our
    website.
    See [[the configuration section|HTTP_mirror_pool#configuration]]
    for details.

* Keep using DNS to point to 3-5 fast and reliable mirrors. This will
  be the fallback for people who do not use JS. So we still need a DNS
  dynamic update system; we can simply re-purpose the one we already
  have (`dl.amnesia.boum.org`).

<a id="questions"></a>

## Remaining questions

* What to do for downloads we offer outside of the Installation
  Assistant, that are not supported by DAVE, such as images for
  release candidates? What to do for browsers that don't have DAVE,
  e.g. non-Firefox browsers, the
  [[wget download option|install/expert/usb]], and
  documented download methods that rely on
  [[!tails_gitweb wiki/src/install/inc/steps/download.inline.html]]?
  - A first iteration could simply use the DNS pool. This might put
    too much load on the few servers in it though, so it might only
    work if we're able to add a few really fast servers in it.
  - In second iteration, we can use our JavaScript dispatcher code to rewrite the
    download link on the call for testing web page. If we do this, we
    need to include our JavaScript library in a dedicated ikiwiki
    overlay, and load + call it on every page that contains an ISO
    download link (or simply on _every_ page).
  - It might be that going straight to the second iteration is simpler
    in the end. Or, we can forget the non-DAVE dispatcher code and
    instead put energy into adding very fast and reliable mirrors to
    the DNS pool, as
    [is being discussed](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2016-February/010282.html).

* What to do for the IUK downloads done by Tails Upgrader?

<a id="configuration"></a>

# Mirror pool configuration

The client dispatcher code fetches the mirror pool configuration file
from our website.

The configuration file is written in JSON (and not YAML), to avoid the
need to use a third-party parser.

The configuration file is stored in a dedicated Git repository
([[!tails_gitweb_repo mirror-pool desc="public read-only mirror"]]),
that is added to our website with the ikiwiki underlay mechanism.
Using a separate Git repository gives us finer-grained access control
possibilities in the long run, e.g. we may want to let people who
don't have commit access to Git maintain the mirrors pool. Note that
we'll need to serve the configuration file from outside our website if
we ever want to do so: an _underlay_ can affect our website in ways
that are probably (almost?) as bad as what one can do with Git access
to the website itself.

The configuration file is essentially a list of mirrors, and for each
of them we need a few values:

 * url_prefix: whatever needs to be pre-pended to the path to an ISO
   (e.g. `/stable/tails-i386-2.0/tails-i386-2.0.iso`) that is shared
   between all mirrors, to form a complete URL to that ISO; for
   example:
   - in the old mirror pool design, this would be
     `http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails`
   - in the new mirror pool design, this could be e.g.
     `http://42.dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails` (for mirrors who want to
     use the unique VirtualHost we provide them), or something they
     deal with themselves, e.g. `https://mirrors.kernel.org/tails`

 * weight: the probability this mirror has to be picked by the
   dispatcher code, expressed as a non-negative integer; weight
   0 means that the mirror is currently disabled, and will never be
   redirected to

 * email (optional): the email address of the mirror's operator

 * notes (optional): various additional notes that can be useful to
   the managers of the mirror pool

For a more formal, and probably more up-to-date definition of the data
model, better see
[its JSON schema](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/mirror-pool/tree/schema.json).

Here is
[an example configuration file](https://git-tails.immerda.ch/mirror-pool/tree/example-mirrors.json).

# Speed

This is mainly for [[!tails_ticket 10295]].

## Potentially fast & reliable enough mirrors

i.e. those that I've seen provide good speed and that have had no
reliability issue in the last N months.

Note: measurements done from lizard are capped to 100Mbps due to
upstream network configuration, so they can barely be used to reliably
compare those fast mirrors with each other. For measurements done from
Germany, upstream network should not be the limiting factor for most
practical purposes here.
