[[!meta title="Explain Tails"]]

Open relationship
-----------------

Tails is not my main operating system: Tails does not make me choose
between itself and other operating systems. With Tails I have an open
relationship. Is not my main operating system, I have other operating
systems for other things.

One in my laptop, one in my school...

Tails is not jealous and does not aim to fulfill all my computer needs:
if I need something Tails cannot give me... I can use another operating
system!

But I respect our relationship: Tails does not want to be plugged to my
laptop if I am running other operating systems, so I never do that.

And I don't use identities I use on other operating systems from the
same Tails USB stick.
