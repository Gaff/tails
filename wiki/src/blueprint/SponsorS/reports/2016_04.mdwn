can be helpful.

This reports covers the activity of Tails in April 2016.

Everything in this report is public.

# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

## A.n. description of subsection

- A.n.m. description of deliverable: ticket numbers

  status summary:

  * what was done
  * what is the outcome (how it makes Tails better)
  * what was not done, and why

# B. Improve our quality assurance process


# C. Scale our infrastructure

## C.1. Change in depth the infrastructure of our pool of mirrors

XXX: see March report for ticket numbers about other C.1.n's.

* DAVE ([[!tails_ticket 11109]])
  - The URL used for a new download is now built using our mirror pool
    (example) config, using our mirror-dispatcher.js library.
  - Next WIP step (as of 20160408): support resuming an existing
    download (that may have been started using another mirror than the
    one we would like to use this time).
  - And then we'll want other people to review and audit our
    proposed changes.

* C.1.3. Design and implement the mirrors pool administration process and tools ([[!tails_ticket 8638]], [[!tails_ticket 11122]], [[!tails_ticket 11054]], [[!tails_ticket 11335]])

* C.1.5. Deploy the script and the mirror pool description ([[!tails_ticket 8641]], XXX)

  They are now live on our website, but not used yet until C.1.6.

  Let's say this now includes [[!tails_ticket 10295]] and
  [[!tails_ticket 11284]].

* C.1.6. Adjust download documentation to point to the mirror pool dispatcher's URL ([[!tails_ticket 8642]], [[!tails_ticket 11329]])

* C.1.8. Clean up the remainers of the old mirror pool setup ([[!tails_ticket 8643]])


# D. Migration to Debian Jessie


# E. Release management
