[[!meta title="Foundations Team"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

The Tails Foundations Team is responsible for:

* maintaining the core Tails system, which includes e.g.
  - porting Tails to the new version of its upstream foundations, such
    as a new Debian, Tor or Tor Browser;
  - keeping our core code base up-to-date and maintainable, e.g.
    refactor or clean up stuff that has bit-rotted, migrate code that
    would otherwise rely on obsolete technologies;
  - maintaining the ISO build system;
  - doing the _extra_ peer-review and
    [[release management|release manager]] work that corresponds to
    the above bullet points;

* welcoming new code contributors, e.g. when enough mentoring is
  required to put it outside of the scope of the [[release manager]]'s
  duty to review code contributions;

* reviewing code contributions that are on nobody else's plate, e.g.
  those submitted by the [[release manager]], and the translation
  merge requests sent to <tails-l10n@boum.org>;

* ensuring that development discussions started on
  <tails-dev@boum.org> are followed-up;

* if time allows, do whatever code task the project sees as
  top-priority, such as fixing Holes in the Roof, important bugs, or
  implementing a feature that is needed to keep Tails relevant.
