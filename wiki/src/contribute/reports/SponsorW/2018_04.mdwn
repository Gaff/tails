This report covers the activity of Tails in April 2018.

Everything in this report is public.

# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.4 Add VeraCrypt support to udisks

Our udisks pull request
[#495](https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks/pull/495)
has been merged upstream so this deliverable is now completed.

## A.6 Add VeraCrypt support to GNOME Files

We added support to unlock VeraCrypt containers via the unlock dialog
opened by `gvfs-udisks2-volume-monitor`, which now allows unlocking
encrypted volumes via GNOME Files or when the storage device is
plugged in ([[!tails_ticket 15218]]).

## A.10 Port to the latest version of GNOME

Instead of developing for the GNOME version we use in Tails and
forward-porting our patches, we decided to develop for the latest
version of GNOME and backport the patches to the version we use in
Tails. Therefore, we backported our udisks and GNOME Disks patches
([[!tails_ticket 15253]], [[!tails_ticket 15515]]) and created Debian
packages to use them in Tails ([[!tails_ticket 15522]],
[[!tails_ticket 15523]]).

# B. Additional software

## B.4 Implement backend and GUI

We [[!tails_ticket 15544 desc="polished a bit"]] the wording of the
persistent volume configuration GUI. We fixed issues with the early implementation ([[!tails_ticket 15431]], [[!tails_ticket 15430]], [[!tails_ticket 15386]], [[!tails_ticket 15382]], [[!tails_ticket 15380]])

We also identified and fixed
a [[!tails_ticket 15550 desc="regression"]] introduced as part of the
initial implementation of this activity.

We are now working on releasing a beta version for wider testing of this new feature ([[!tails_ticket 14599]]).

## B.6 Write user documentation

We wrote a [draft of the user documentation](https://git.tails.boum.org/tails/tree/wiki/src/doc/first_steps/additional_software.mdwn?h=feature/14594-asp-gui) ([[!tails_ticket 14589]]).

## B.7 User testing

We prepared the user testing that will happen in the first week of May
([[!tails_ticket 14591]]).
