This reports covers the activity of Tails in June 2016.

Everything in this report is public.

# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

## A.1.1. Secure the Icedove autoconfig wizard

Despite having thouroughly tested our work on reenabling the
autoconfiguration wizard in Icedove, we received reports, that in some
cases where the ISP uses OAuth, as for example Gmail, people were
unable to set up an email account. One of these issues, the spurious
inability to set up accounts, has been resolved and will be available
in the next Tails release ( [[!tails_ticket 11550]]). The OAuth issue
has been identified and is currently being worked on
([[!tails_ticket 11536]]). A third issue concerning intermittently
failing TLS connections needs more testing ([[!tails_ticket 10933]]).

## A.1.2. Make our improvements maintainable for future versions of Icedove

The second iteration of our patches for Icedove has been reviewed and
integration with upstream's testing suite has been asked for in reply.
We've been working on writing tests for our patches, but another
iteration of those is necessary. See the
[[!mozbug 971347 desc="upstream bug"]] for details.

The Tor project has released
[Torbirdy 0.2.0](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/torbirdy-020-sixth-beta-release)
on June 27th 2016. This release contains patches we wrote,
as well as patches by Arthur Edelstein, that fix the privacy leaks
identified initially by taqnaq. An updated Debian package is currently
being uploaded.

# B. Improve our quality assurance process

## B.3. Extend the coverage of our test suite

### B.3.10. Write automated tests for features added in 2016Q1

We added a new test for the Tails Greeter "Disable all networking"
option ([[!tails_ticket 10340]]).

Since we dropped Vidalia as it was not maintained anymore, and replaced
it with Tor Status and Onion Circuits, we adapted our test suite accordingly
([[!tails_ticket 6841]]).

We had to update some test suite scenarios after having enabled Tor
Browser's font fingerprinting protection in Tails, as most of its
related screenshots didn't work anymore ([[!tails_ticket 11097]]).

### B.3.11. Fix newly identified issues to make our test suite more robust and faster

We've identified the reason why sometimes our test suite is not
able to add the necessary kernel command line options to the Tails
system it tests. The fix is not that easy to implement, and solutions
are being worked on. A patch is under test and we intend to fix this
issue in July ([[!tails_ticket 10777]]).

We've investigated why our test suite sometimes fails because of time
synchronization errors. Auditing our [[htpdate
script|contribute/design/Time_syncing]] showed that it may not have the
best defaults for it to work correctly on sloppy network connections. A
patch has been proposed and is being tested ([[!tails_ticket 10494]]).

A patch implementing a way to retry Synaptic related tests on
network transient errors or if Synaptic segfaults is under test and will
be proposed to be merged soon ([[!tails_ticket 10441]] and
[[!tails_ticket 10412]]).

We also implemented a similar solution on the Git scenarios, which have proven
to be fragile because of network errors. A patch has been widely tested,
and will likely be merged soon ([[!tails_ticket 10444]]).

Thanks to Dogtail ([[!tails_ticket 10721]]), whose integration was
worked on in the past few months, we could make a robust fix for:

- The "the Tor Browser loads the (startup page|Tails roadmap) step is
  fragile ([[!tails_ticket 10376]])

and also make the implementation simpler and more future proof for:

- Adjust test suite after upgrading Tor Browser to the 6.0.x series,
  based on Firefox 45.2 ([[!tails_ticket 11403]])

### B.3.13. Reorganize the "various checks" feature ([[!tails_ticket 5707]])

A branch that splits this feature's scenarios into more relevant
thematic features has been proposed for review. It should be merged
soon.

### B.3.14. Write tests for incremental upgrades ([[!tails_ticket 6309]])

A branch testing the Tails incremental upgrades have been pushed and
proposed to review. Issues with it were raised and a fix promptly
pushed. It's receiving the last round of review and will likely be
merged soon.

### B.3.15. Write automated tests for features added in 2016Q2

A test was proposed to review, that covers a regression we have
identified and fixed a few months ago, in one of Tails' persistence
features ([[!tails_ticket 10840]]).

We added a test for reconfiguring an existing persistence partition â€” we only tested
its initial creation so far ([[!tails_ticket 10834]]).

After forbidding the Tor Browser to start any external application
(for improved security, see [[!tails_ticket 9285]]) a test that
previously did just that was converted to a test for downloading
files.

While upgrading the Tor Browser to the 6.0.x series, based on a new
major Firefox release (45.2, see [[!tails_ticket 11403]]) tests were
adjusted to new application behavior and appearance of the browser's
graphical user interface.

## B.4. Freezable APT repository

The system has been working fine in production for a while now, and as
reported last month all parts of this deliverable have now been completed.

In June, we have polished a bit the design documentation for the
entire setup ([[!tails_ticket 11447]]).

And, in July we want to do various polishing tasks:

* If needed, write helper tools for freeze exceptions
  ([[!tails_ticket 11448]]).

* Investigate a weird issue we have identified, when a package is
  not removed from our time-based APT snapshots, while it should be
  ([[!tails_ticket 11496]]).

* Deal with the consequences that our new APT snapshots system has
  on our server's `apt-cacher-ng` cache size ([[!tails_ticket 11532]]).

# C. Scale our infrastructure

## C.1. Change in depth the infrastructure of our pool of mirrors

We now have 39 active mirrors.

The work that remains to be done in July is:

- C.1.2. Write & audit the code that makes the redirection decision from our website ([[!tails_ticket 8639]], [[!tails_ticket 8640]], [[!tails_ticket 11109]])

  * `mirror-dispatcher.js`: we are still waiting for the auditor to do
    a final security review.

  * Download And Verification Extension (DAVE) for Firefox: the code
    needs to be reviewed by the original author of the extension and the
    code for resuming downloads still needs to be improved and tested.

- C.1.8. Clean up the remainders of the old mirror pool setup ([[!tails_ticket 8643]], [[!tails_ticket 11284]])

  This is now only blocked by the work that is in progress on DAVE
  (C.1.2).

## C.4. Maintain our already existing services

- C.4.6. Administer our services up to milestone VI

  We kept on answering the requests from the community and taking care
  of security updates.

  We [[!tails_ticket 11213 desc="refactored"]] the Puppet bits that
  configure our servers' firewall.

  We debugged and fixed a nasty problem that prevented the `testing`
  Git branch from being automatically tested on our infrastructure
  ([[!tails_ticket 11499]]).

  One of us participated in a Puppet sprint at
  [DebCamp](https://debconf16.debconf.org/), where a team did improved
  the `puppet` and `apt` modules we are using on our infrastructure.

# E. Release management

[[Tails 2.4|news/version_2.4]] was released on June 7.
