[[!meta title="Checklist for updating po_translatable_pages"]]

- Update `po_translatable_pages` in both *ikiwiki.setup* and
  *ikiwiki-cgi.setup*.

- Make sure that PO files for the pages that are changed in
  `po_translatable_pages` are either removed or added accordingly.

- Adjust the inline directives that might reference the pages that are
  changed in `po_translatable_pages`. To identify them, execute:
  - `git grep '!inline.*currentlang' -- '*.*m*'`

- Update PO files and unfuzz machine-readable strings.

- Notify [[root@boum.org]] to update the configuration of our production
  website.
