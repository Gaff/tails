These instructions require:

  - Debian 8 (Jessie) or later
  - Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf) or later

If your version of Debian or Ubuntu is not supported, you can follow the
instructions for [[other Linux distributions|install/linux/usb/overview]]
instead. But they are more complicated and require two USB sticks instead of
one.
