"  * Major new features and changes\n"
"    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 6.0 based on Firefox 45.2. (Closes:\n"
"      [[!tails_ticket 11403]]).\n"
"    - Enable Icedove's automatic configuration wizard. We patch the\n"
"      wizard to only use secure protocols when probing, and only\n"
"      accept secure protocols, while keeping the improvements done by\n"
"      TorBirdy in its own non-automatic configuration wizard. (Closes:\n"
"      [[!tails_ticket 6158]], [[!tails_ticket 11204]])\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"  * Bugfixes\n"
"    - Enable Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery for IPv4. If any\n"
"      system on the path to the remote host has a MTU smaller than the\n"
"      standard Ethernet one, then Tails will receive an ICMP packet\n"
"      asking it to send smaller packets. Our firewall will drop such\n"
"      ICMP packets to the floor, and then the TCP connection won't\n"
"      work properly. This can happen to any TCP connection, but so far\n"
"      it's been reported as breaking obfs4 for actual users. Thanks to\n"
"      Yawning for the help! (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 9268]])\n"
"    - Make Tails Upgrader ship other locales than English. (Closes:\n"
"      [[!tails_ticket 10221]])\n"

"  * Minor improvements\n"
"    - Icedove improvements:\n"
"      * Stop patching in our default into Torbirdy. We've upstreamed\n"
"        some parts, and the rest we set with pref branch overrides in\n"
"        /etc/xul-ext/torbirdy.js. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 10905]])\n"
"      * Use hkps keyserver in Engimail. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 10906]])\n"
"      * Default to POP if persistence is enabled, IMAP if\n"
"        not. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 10574]])\n"
"      * Disable remote email account creation in Icedove. (Closes:\n"
"        [[!tails_ticket 10464]])\n"
"    - Firewall hardening (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 11391]]):\n"
"      * Don't accept RELATED packets. This enables quite a lot of code\n"
"        in the kernel that we don't need. Let's reduce the attack\n"
"        surface a bit.\n"
"      * Restrict debian-tor user to NEW TCP syn packets. It doesn't\n"
"        need to do more, so let's do a little bit of security in\n"
"        depth.\n"
"      * Disable netfilter's nf_conntrack_helper.\n"
"      * Fix disabling of automatic conntrack helper assignment.\n"
"    - Kernel hardening:\n"
"      * Set various kernel boot options: slab_nomerge slub_debug=FZ\n"
"        mce=0 vsyscall=none. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 11143]])\n"
"      * Remove the kernel .map files. These are only useful for kernel\n"
"        debugging and slightly make things easier for malware, perhaps\n"
"        and otherwise just occupy disk space. Also stop exposing\n"
"        kernel memory addresses through /proc etc. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 10951]])\n"
"    - Drop zenity hacks to \"focus\" the negative answer. Jessie's\n"
"      zenity introduced the --default-cancel option, finally!\n"
"      (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 11229]])\n"
"    - Drop useless APT pinning for Linux.\n"
"    - Remove gnome-tweak-tool. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 11237]])\n"
"    - Install python-dogtail, to enable accessibility technologies in\n"
"      our automated test suite. (Part of: [[!tails_ticket 10721]])\n"
"    - Install libdrm and mesa from jessie-backports. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 11303]])\n"
"    - Remove hledger. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 11346]])\n"
"    - Don't pre-configure the #tails chan on the default OFTC account.\n"
"      (Part of: [[!tails_ticket 11306]])\n"
"    - Install onioncircuits from jessie-backports. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 11443]])\n"
"    - Remove nmh. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 10477]])\n"
"    - Drop Debian experimental APT source: we don't use it.\n"
"    - Use APT codenames (e.g. \"stretch\") instead of suites, to be\n"
"      compatible with our tagged APT snapshots.\n"
"    - Drop module-assistant hook and its cleanup. We've not been using\n"
"      it since 2010.\n"
"    - Remove 'Reboot' and 'Power Off' entries from Applications →\n"
"      System Tools. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 11075]])\n"
"    - Pin our custom APT repo to the same level as Debian ones, and\n"
"      explicitly pin higher the packages we want to pull from our custom\n"
"      APT repo, when needed.\n"
"    - config/chroot_local-hooks/59-libdvd-pkg: verify libdvdcss\n"
"      package installation. (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 11420]])\n"
"    - Make Tails Upgrader use our new mirror pool design. (Closes:\n"
"      [[!tails_ticket 11123]])\n"
